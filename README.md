LillyPod app

Easily access your podcast playlist by having a list of specific ones you've added to your podcast list.

This app will provide access to new and favorite podcasts by allowing the user to choose from a provided list by type, genre, language, host/author, and length.

The user will get a list of available choices and they will be able to choose specific podcasts to add/delete their podcast playlist. Listen immediately via the audio link or on your favorite podcatcher. 

This app uses a Node and Express Web Server backed by a MySQL Database.

This app queries the “Listen Notes” API using GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Users are authenticated via passport.authenticate Connect middleware.
