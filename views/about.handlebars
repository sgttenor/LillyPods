        <p>There are numerous podcasts across numerous platforms, and it gets frustrating going through multiple apps to find the podcast that has that one story you were listening to. Introducing Lily Pod. The app that allows you to request content via title, host or genre and gives you ways to store them, in one place!</p>

        <p>Have you heard that one Podcast?” If you haven’t, you better get to it! Introducing Lily Pod. The App that lets you search Podcasts via Title, Host or Genre and save them all in one spot. Multiple platform browsing is an inconvenience of the past. Welcome Home, Lily Pod.</p>

        <p>Between Adnan Syed, Jon B. Macklemore, Curtis Flowers and Jen and Sarah Hart, the world seems DIM. What sounds better than creating your own personal playlists of let’s say, a mix of show monologues and new recipes or simply a separate playlist of speaker podcasts on Kites. You make the decisions here, Lily Pod.</p>
